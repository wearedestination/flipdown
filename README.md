# FlipDown

‚è∞ A lightweight and performant flip styled countdown clock.

Forked by Destination for use as an ES module

## Features

-   üí° Lightweight - No jQuery! <11KB minified bundle
-   ‚ö° Performant - Animations powered by CSS transitions
-   üì± Responsive - Works great on screens of all sizes
-   üé® Themeable - Choose from built-in themes, or add your own
-   üåç i18n - Customisable headings for your language

## Basic Usage

To get started, install with `npm install @destination/flipdown` or `yarn add @destination/flipdown`.

For basic usage, FlipDown takes a unix timestamp (in seconds) as an argument.

```js
import { FlipDown } from "@destination/flipdown";
import "@destination/flipdown/dist/dark.css";
import "@destination/flipdown/dist/flipdown.css";

new FlipDown(1538137672, '#flipdown').start();
```

```html
<div id="flipdown" class="flipdown"></div>
```

### Custom Themes

Custom themes can be added by adding a new stylesheet using the FlipDown [theme template](https://github.com/PButcher/flipdown/blob/master/src/flipdown.css#L3-L34).

FlipDown themes must have the class name prefix of: `.flipdown__theme-` followed by the name of your theme. For example, the standard theme class names are:

-   `.flipdown__theme-dark`
-   `.flipdown__theme-light`

You can then load your theme by specifying the `theme` property in the `opt` object of the constructor (see [Themes](#Themes)).

## Headings

You can add your own rotor group headings by passing an array as part of the `opt` object. Bear in mind this won't change the functionality of the rotors (eg: the 'days' rotor won't magically start counting months because you passed it 'Months' as a heading).

Suggested use is for i18n. Usage as follows:

```javascript
new FlipDown(1538137672, '#flipdown', {
    headings: ["Nap", "√ìra", "Perc", "M√°sodperc"]
}).start();
```

Note that headings will default to English if not provided: `["Days", "Hours", "Minutes", "Seconds"]`
